# Datasheets-for-Earth-Science-Datasets
Welcome! This repository contains the “beta version” of Datasheets for Earth Science Datasets released for feedback, comments, and questions from the broader Earth science community. Please check out the **InstructionalGuide** to learn more!

# Contents
* **InstructionalGuide**: Read this first! Describes the Datasheets for Earth Science Datasets concept, provides instructions for filling out a datasheet, and answers common questions.
* **blank_EarthScienceDatasheet**: A blank PDF datasheet template.
* **blank_LaTeX/**: Contains blank LaTeX datasheet files.
* **demo_EarthScienceDatasheets/**: Two demonstration datasheets filled out by Charlotte Connolly and Daniel Hueholt. ***Please read the InstructionalGuide file before the demonstration datasheets!***
* **GebruEtAl_DatasheetsForDatasets**: The original paper by Gebru et al. proposing [Datasheets for Datasets for software engineering](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/12/256932-datasheets-for-datasets/abstract). We have adapted this format for Earth science applications. (Please note that we had no relation to this original work!)
